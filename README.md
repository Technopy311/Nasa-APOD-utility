### Alert:
This utility, was designed for **_Windows_**, 
and maybe MacOs, but never tested in MacOs, it was tested and made
in Ubuntu LTS 20.4, then optimized just for Windows, so it will only work in windows
this utility only uses python and no other languages.

This utility **has** been optimized 100% now.

## Installing Instructions.
First clone the repo, then in the repo folder, 
you just need to execute in a terminal

> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Or if it doesn't works, try making:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

The last step is you to get an api key, (it's 100% free),
you can get it at: https://api.nasa.gov/?ref=public-apis#signUp


Then just execute the script in the terminal:

Windows:

> python3 ./main.py

or in windows:

> python3 .\mainpy

For setting up the proper configurations of the utility,
in the "main menu", choose the **option 5** (Initial Setup),
then choose between one of the 2 options of setting up
and then just **follow the instructions of the assistant.**

then, if all goes right, the setup will be completed
if in any case, you need to change the background path, 
or the api-key, just run the assistant again.
**Advice: each time you run the assistant,**
**the config files are reseted**
