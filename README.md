# NASA APOD Utility

### This python3 script has been made only for fun and for killing time
### And it's not official by NASA.

***

### Alert:
This script, was designed overall, for **_linux enviroments_**, 
and maybe MacOs, but never tested in MacOs, it was tested and made
in Ubuntu LTS 20.4, alias focal, so it will certainly work on any debian
based distro like ubuntu-mint, or in Raspberry Pi OS.
it only uses python and no other languages.
It hasn't been tested on fedora, gentoo or arch based 
distros, so it's not known if it will work properly on 
any of these, or other.

## Installing Instructions.
First clone the repo, then in the repo folder, 
you just need to execute in the terminal

> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Or if it doesn't works, try making:
> pip install -r requirements.txt


Then for executing the script, just make in the terminal


> python3 ./main.py

For setting up the proper configurations of the script,
**just run it**, and in the option selector, choose the
**option 5**, then choose between *one of the 2 options* of setting up
and then ***follow the instructions of the assistant.***
